### Hi

I love writing code and facing the challenges that come with being a software developer.

I originally am a self taught developer but am currently studying a Bachelor of ICT at Western Sydney University, right now I am on exchange and I have joined the Bachelor of Artificial Intelligence at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona.

My current focus is learning machine learning and neural networks.
